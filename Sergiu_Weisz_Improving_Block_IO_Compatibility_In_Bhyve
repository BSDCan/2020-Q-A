<jhb>:
Have you thought about using range locks on the backing file up
front before servicing an I/O request so that you could allow
non-overlappin I/O requests to run in parallel?

I realize you might still need to do some serialization for writes
that alter the L1/L2 tables themselves using probably a separate lock
in the process itself.  (Presumably you cache the L1 at least and
possibly L2)

plans when this hits head?

and how to identify/fix sizings

<double-p> 'but the main thing is differing block/page sizes, right?' and you said yes.. so how to "fix" this
