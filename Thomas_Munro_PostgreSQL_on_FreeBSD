<DruidZ> [Q] how much of this applies to other BSDs?

<crest> [Q] would it make sense to have a single setting to optimize
pgsql defaults for copy on write filesystems? or maybe even one for
all things zfs allows you to get away with e.g. no torn writes?

<crest> [Q] aio_* variants of which system calls would help postgresql
the most?

<crest> [Q] how does postgresql react if the strcoll_l() sorting
changes on system upgrades?

<debdrup> [Q] Does NetBSD support POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED for ZFS in 9.0-RELEASE?

<debdrup> [Q] Will POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED benefit from the NFS4.2 IO_ADVISE?

<pjd> [Q] So, if I can afford losing some changes to my database, what
would make it bad idea to disable fsync on ZFS?

<crest> [Q] does postgresql plan on using async list i/o?

<AllanJude> [Q] Have you looked at the recent proposals for O_DIRECT

be input you could provide on the design to make sure it will be
useful?
