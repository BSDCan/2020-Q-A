Questions for Andre Buskvekster on the Presentation: Editing Movies on OpenBSD

1. Can't you use -to in ffmpeg instead of converting time and using -t?
2. Why do you embed this processing step in R? Was that mentioned?
3. synchronizing audio and video tracks is sometimes tricky and non-intuitive.  Hence SMPTE.  Do you encounter these problems?
4. If you have many cores, is parallelizing this as simple as "make -j"
