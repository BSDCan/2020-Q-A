1.  So what's the status of being able to grow a RaidZn pool?
A: 

2. is that s3 backed vdev vapourware like block pointer re-writing?

3. Does anyone use the autoreplace property on their pool (ie. automatically using a new disk when it's inserted, in a slot where there used to be a disk) ?

4.  will swap on zvol ever work correctly?

5.  is anyone working on getting ZFS and NUMA to play nice and allow the ARC to be larger than 80% of the smallest numa domain?
