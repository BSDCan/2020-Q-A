# Kernel TLS in FreeBSD
Speaker: John Baldwin

## Questions

### Does KTLS benefit from the OCF updates heading into HEAD, ie. if TLSv1.4 or 1.5 add new crypto primitives, it can be added in only one place in the kernel?
Requester: debrup
Yes (Answered in the talk)

### Will be possible to get a data only file descriptor for a ktls socket with ktls send and recv implemented. i would like to keep the key exchange i a different process
Requester: crest
In the send case that is what you get, its transparent to the kernel. The recieve side is more complicated and we need to and you need to use recieve message, and its not a straight read to get your data on the recieve side.

### Do you know if the work by rmacklem@ on TLS encrypted NFS going to be benefiting from kTLS too?
Requester: debrup
<crest> looks like he uses ktls only with a userspace helper. but sofar only supports tls1.2 because ktls doesn't support tls1.3 (yet) 
Its not feesible without the kTLS work, so it is going to make use of it.

### So SW kTLS benefits from aesni(4) since that's conceptually software (as opposed to hifn(4) and ubsec(4) which are hardware)?
Requester: debrup
Yes, its in the 13-CURRENT branch. (Answered in the talk) Added: It can take many forms. so its still using software even if its using the coprocessor

### How much did the kernel crypto framework have to change for ktls?
Requester: crest
It helped.

### Is someone working on socket splicing for ktls to offload things like haproxy with reencryption?
Requester: crest
No, there is nobody currently looking at it.

###  How much work would it be to add ktls to gnutls?
Requester: crest
probably not a ton, and probably portable.

### does freebsd have real sendmmsg() / recvmmsg()? 
Requester: crest

### Oh, so SW kTLS can even be something like the NEON stuff on ARM or RISC-V vector extensions
Requester: debrup
Got added to the OCF today, https://svnweb.freebsd.org/changeset/base/361809

### do you plan to support chacha20 and poly1305?
