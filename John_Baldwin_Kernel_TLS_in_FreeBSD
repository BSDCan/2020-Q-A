# Kernel TLS in FreeBSD
Speaker: John Baldwin

## Questions

### Does KTLS benefit from the OCF updates heading into HEAD, ie. if TLSv1.4 or 1.5 add new crypto primitives, it can be added in only one place in the kernel?
Requester: debrup

### will be possible to get a data only file descriptor for a ktls socket with ktls send and recv implemented. i would like to keep the key exchange i a different process
Requester: crest

### Do you know if the work by rmacklem@ on TLS encrypted NFS going to be benefiting from kTLS too?
Requester: debrup
<crest> looks like he uses ktls only with a userspace helper. but sofar only supports tls1.2 because ktls doesn't support tls1.3 (yet) 

### So SW kTLS benefits from aesni(4) since that's conceptually software (as opposed to hifn(4) and ubsec(4) which are hardware)?
Requester: debrup

### how much did the kernel crypto framework have to change for ktls?
Requester: crest

### is someone working on socket splicing for ktls to offload things like haproxy with reencryption?
Requester: crest
